                    <p className='text'>Do you experience daily restlessness and stress? Do you sleep badly and are you perhaps struggling with overstrain? There is a good chance that unpleasant discomforts have also arisen, such as fatigue, intestinal complaints and skin problems. This is because we cannot see body and mind separately. It is one system. Everything we put into our body through food, but also how we experience our day, has an enormous influence on our state of being.</p>
                    <p className='text'>At De Leefstylist you will discover how you can gently regain control over your body and mind through nutrition and lifestyle, so that you can fully enjoy life again. Together we work on a healthy and sustainable lifestyle, where you learn how to bring your own system back to rest. Knowledge that you will carry with you for the rest of your life!</p>
                    <p className='text'>Are you curious about what I can do for you? Book a free introductory meeting or get to know me better via this website; because I too did not find my way to health just like that. Maybe you recognize something in my story ?</p>
